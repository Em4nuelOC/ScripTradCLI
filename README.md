# COMPUTER ASSISTED TRANSLATION CROSS-PLATFORM APP
<p> App developed using Ionic, an open source framework which provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile, 
desktop, and progressive web apps based on modern web development technologies and practices, using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass.</p>

<p>This project was designed from my own experience as a translator, thinking on those things 
I would have like to have to make translation easier and faster, I wanted to build something useful and user friendly.</p>

<p>It is not only a translation, but a management app as it covers two of the most important roles in translation process, translator and project manager.</p>
